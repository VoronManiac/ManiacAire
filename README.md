# V2.4-Aire #
Each Aire filter has a HEPA particle prefilter followed by an activated charcoal filter, and is targeted at Voron 2.4 250/300/350 printers. Ideally, a pair of filters is mounted on either side of the print bed.  The filter Z height is constrained to 35mm max which is slightly below the print bed surface of a typical V2.4.

The design is optimized for high air flow to increase the turnover rate of heated chamber air.  Aire uses inexpensive Eufy RoboVAC HEPA filters.  Sufficient space is provided between the Eufy HEPA filter and the 5015 blower intake to prevent the blower from stalling.  The blower exhaust feeds the single piece activated carbon cartridge.  The cartridge attaches to the HEPA/blower section with magnets. Once loaded with charcoal, two small doors slide into place to close off the cartridge. As shown below, the airpath in the cartridge splits into two sections of constant width to reduce back pressure. Increasing the charcoal capacity of the filter by making it longer actually reduces the back pressure.  Each 95mm cartrudge has similar charcoal capacitiy compared to NeverMore DuoV5.
